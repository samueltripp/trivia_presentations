Python to construct a trivia powerpoint

For when I write trivia, I find it annoying any time I change a question to have to change it in multiple places. Given a text file in the correct format, this pyhton code creates the corresponding Powerpoint presentation. You need to change the name to the correct prefix but otherwise it runs. 

It is rigid. Any creativity or flexibility can be adapted from this, or just manually modified on the Powerpoint.
